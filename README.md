# ProjectShowdown
"Project Showdown" is a 2D side-scrolling tower defence game created as part of my A-Level Computer Science course.

## Setup
Before opening this project, you must [download and install Unity](https://unity.com/download). This will require you to create a Unity ID. When installing your Unity version, install the [LTS 2020.3.33f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) release.

Ensure the "Windows Build Support (Mono)" and "Linux Build Support (Mono)" modules are installed in order to build the game on its supported platforms. By default, build support for your machine's OS is installed. Installed modules can be viewed from Unity Hub's "Installs" tab.
  
To install additional modules or build support:
1. Navigate to Unity Hub's "Installs" tab.
2. Click the cog icon on the installed Unity version and select "Add Modules" from the dialog that appears.
3. Select the required module(s) from the list using their corresponding checkboxes.
4. Once you have selected the required module(s), click "Install" to install them.
  
Once Unity has been installed and set up, open this project using the Unity Hub.

## Build
To build the game:
1. Open the project's "Build Settings" (File > Build Settings).
2. Select the appropriate target platform (Windows/Linux) from the "Target Platform" dropdown.
3. Click "Build" or "Build And Run" and provide a location to store the build on your system to build the game or build and run the game.
